# DataStore_Stats

DataStore_Stats is part World of Warcraft Add-on that is part of the DataStore series.
It is compatible with all versions of the game.

Its purpose is to scan and store data related to statistics (base/melee/etc..) for all your characters, and act as a data abstraction layer for client addons, which no longer have to scan or store this information.
